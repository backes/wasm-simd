This file has performance information for x64/ARM64 that you can expect out of WASM SIMD.

For each SIMD instruction, you can see the number of instructions that v8 generates.

Note that while instruction count isn't always indicative of performance, it can give you an insight into what instructions to use and what to avoid.

The instruction counts are assuming AVX2 / AArch64 codegen respectively.
